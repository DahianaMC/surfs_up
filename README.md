Analysis of weather data using Jupyter Notebook and SQlite
# Challenge
- The challenge presents the statistics for the temperature for all stations and years for the months of June and December.
# Files 
- Challenge file: climate_analysis.ipynb
- Flask file: app.py
# Findings:
  - In general December has lower temperatures comparing with June.
  - In December the average temperature (71) is almost 4 degrees F less than in June (74.94)
  - The minimum temperature in Dec is 56F and in June is 64F.
  - The maximun temperature in Dec is 83F and in June is 85F.
  - The total rows taking for the statistics for Dec was 1517 and for June was 1700.
  - The percentiles for Dec are 75% is 74, 50% is 71 and 25% is 69.  
  - The percentiles for June are 75% is 77, 50% is 75 and 25% is 73. 
  - I will say the weather is great whole year. 
  
# Recommendations
  - We can make the statistics by stations and compare to know if there is any difference in temperature by stations.
  - Also doing the statistics for precipitation could be good, because seems there are some zones where raining could happen often.
  - Since the location for each station is provided will be easier to identify where are the better zones based on temperature and precipitation.
  - We can find the statistics for temperature and precipitation by year and evaluate how much the weather has change during those years, also we can filter by station.
